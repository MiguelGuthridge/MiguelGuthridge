### Hi, I'm Miguel Guthridge!
He/him

I love music and programming, and I'm passionate about making cool stuff to do cool things.

# My Projects
Here's some of the projects I'm proudest of:

### Universal Controller Script
An advanced application used to link any MIDI controller to any DAW plugin, using FL Studio's Python API.
I made this project to learn about static typing in Python, as well as object oriented programming and design patterns,
as well as to learn about CI/CD practices.

### VC Compiler
A compiler that converts a c-like language VC into Jasmin Assembly and Java bytecode. As this was a university assignment, 
this code is private. I will give access to potential employers on request.

### Equator
A symbolic calculator capable of solving complex simultaneous equations, and presenting results in a clear, logical format.
I made this project to learn about syntax parsing and mathematical programming.

### Dungeon Mania
A university group project I worked on, where we created a complex dungeon crawler game in order to learn object oriented
design in Java. As this was a university assignment, this code is private. I will give access to potential employers on request.
