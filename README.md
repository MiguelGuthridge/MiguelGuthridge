## Hi, I'm Miguel Guthridge!

I love music and programming, and I'm passionate about making cool stuff to do cool things.

# My Projects
Here's some of the projects I'm proudest of:

### [Universal Controller Script](https://github.com/MiguelGuthridge/Universal-Controller-Script)
An advanced application used to link any MIDI controller to any DAW plugin, using FL Studio's
Python API. I made this project to help improve the workflow of composing in FL Studio.

### [Ensemble Forum](https://github.com/EnsembleForum/Ensemble#readme)
An education-focused web forum, designed for teachers and students alike. I worked on this 
alongside 4 other team members as my capstone project at UNSW.

### [FL Studio API Stubs](https://github.com/MiguelGuthridge/FL-Studio-API-Stubs)
An emulation of FL Studio's Python API, designed to help people design, write and test code that
interacts with FL Studio.

### VC Compiler
A compiler written in Java that converts a C-like language into Java bytecode. This code is private,
but accessible to potential employers on request.

### Dungeon Mania
A complex dungeion crawler game written in Java with some friends for a university assignment.
This code is private, but accessible to potential employers on request.

### [Jestspectation](https://github.com/MiguelGuthridge/Jestspectation)
A collection of tools that can be used to provide advanced pattern matching of Python's built-in
objects, which can massively improve the readability of unit tests that check lots of deeply-nested
data. It also provides highly-detailed error messages for cases where comparisons fail, including a
Pytest plugin.

# Other projects I've contributed to

### [The F\*ck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck)
A magnificent app which corrects your previous console command.
* [Create a new rule](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck/pull/1302) for when you paste your git URL
  but forget to add the `git clone` to it.

### [Piccolo ORM](https://github.com/piccolo-orm/piccolo)
A fast, user friendly ORM and query builder which supports asyncio.
* [Fix a bug](https://github.com/piccolo-orm/piccolo/pull/673) where a misleading error message 
  was given if you gave incorrect input.
