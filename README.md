# My Projects
Here's some of the projects I'm proudest of:

### [Universal Controller Script](https://github.com/MiguelGuthridge/Universal-Controller-Script)
An advanced application used to link any MIDI controller to any DAW plugin, using FL Studio's 
Python API. I made this project to help improve the workflow of composing in FL Studio.

### [FL Studio API Stubs](https://github.com/MiguelGuthridge/FL-Studio-API-Stubs)
An emulation of FL Studio's Python API, designed to help people design, write and test code that
interacts with FL Studio.

### VC Compiler
A compiler written in Java that converts a C-like language into Java bytecode. This code is private, 
but accessible to potential employers on request.

### Dungeon Mania
A complex dungeion crawler game written in Java with some friends for a university assignment. 
This code is private, but accessible to potential employers on request.

### [Equator](https://github.com/MiguelGuthridge/Equator)
A symbolic calculator capable of solving complex simultaneous equations, and presenting results in 
a clear, logical format. I made this project to learn about syntax parsing and mathematical 
programming.

# Other projects I've contributed to
